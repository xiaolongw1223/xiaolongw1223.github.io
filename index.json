Recent works show that geology differentiation can help maximize the value of information contained in geophysical data. However, it remains largely unexplored as to how to quantify the uncertainties of a 3D quasi-geology model. We approach this problem by using a recently developed mixed Lp norm regularization and a priori physical property measurements. We use mixed $L_p$ norm joint inversion to construct a large sequence of physical property models based on the Gzz component of the airborne gravity gradient and magnetic measurements. The available physical property measurements are used to determine which physical property models to accept. We then construct a sequence of 3D quasi-geology models by performing geology differentiation for all the accepted models, which allows us to compute the probabilities of our geology differentiation results. We apply our approach to a set of field data collected over the Decorah area located in northeast Iowa. We successfully quantify the uncertainties of the spatial extents for the identified geological units and compute probabilities of geologic units at any location in our study area. The proposed workflow has broad implications for 3D geological model building based on multiple geophysical and/or rock sample measurements.","tags":[],"title":"3D probabilistic geology differentiation based on airborne geophysics, mixed Lp norm joint inversion and petrophysical measurements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yanyan Hu","Xiaolong Wei","Xuqing Wu","Jiajia Sun","Jiuping Chen","Yueqin Huang","Jiefu Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1648771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648771200,"objectID":"2833a39d3be2a35375d7082af5707599","permalink":"https://xiaolongw1223.github.io/publication/2022_deep_learning/","publishdate":"2022-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_deep_learning/","section":"publication","summary":"Using joint inversion to reveal underlying geology has drawn considerable research attention due to the availability of multiple geophysical datasets, ever-increasing computational resources, advanced inversion methodologies, and reduced uncertainties. A key issue of joint inversion is to develop effective strategies to link different geophysical data in a unified mathematical framework, where the information obtained from different models can complement each other. In this paper, we propose a deep learning enhanced (DLE) joint inversion framework to simultaneously reconstruct different physical models by fusing different types of geophysical data. Traditionally, structure similarity constraints are pursued by joint inversion algorithms using manually crafted formulations (e.g. cross gradient). In this work, the constraint is constructed by a deep neural network (DNN) during the learning process. The framework is designed to combine the DNN and the traditional independent inversion workflow together and improve the joint inversion result iteratively. The network can be easily extended to incorporate multi-physics without structural changes. Numerical experiments on the joint inversion of 2D DC resistivity data and seismic travel time show that the DLE framework achieves more accurate recovered property values and structural features than independent inversions and conventional cross gradient based joint inversion. In addition, this learning-based framework demonstrates excellent generalization abilities when tested on datasets using divergent geological structures. It can also handle different sensing configurations and nonconforming discretization.","tags":[],"title":"A deep learning enhanced framework for multi-physics joint inversion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaolong Wei","Kenneth Li","Jiajia Sun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1648771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648771200,"objectID":"2161a17c7d877d97dbedb371c1b6dc30","permalink":"https://xiaolongw1223.github.io/publication/2022_elk_creek/","publishdate":"2022-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_elk_creek/","section":"publication","summary":"Critical minerals are an integral part of the energy transition because of their important and, sometimes, irreplaceable uses in solar panels, wind turbines, electrical vehicles, etc. Mapping critical mineral resources is, therefore, essential to achieving the net-zero emission goal by 2050. We present a case study on using airborne geophysical data, borehole and physical property measurements to characterize the Elk Creek Carbonatite complex (ECCC) located in the southeast of Nebraska, US. It hosts the largest known niobium deposit in the United States, and contains a high level of rare earth element (REE) mineralization. Our goal is to develop a better understanding of the 3D structures and compositions of ECCC as well as its critical mineral resources potential. We perform 3D joint inversion of the airborne gravity gradiometry and magnetic data to produce structure similar density and susceptibility models. We carry out geology differentiation, a process of classifying recovered physical property values into distinct units, and obtained a 3D quasi-geology model for the ECCC. We identify 12 geologic units, each of which is characterized by a distinct range of physical property values. Our quasi-geology model, especially Units 9 and 11, shows a remarkable consistency with the borehole assay measurements. Unit 9 is spatially coincident with the known niobium ore zone. Unit 11 represents a significant volume of highly dense and magnetic materials below the deepest boreholes. These materials are likely associated with unexplored niobium mineralization. Our study demonstrates the added value of 3D geophysical joint inversions and geology differentiation in the context of critical mineral exploration under a thick sedimentary overburden.","tags":[],"title":"Mapping critical mineral resources using airborne geophysics, 3D joint inversion and geology differentiation: A case study of a buried niobium deposit in the Elk Creek carbonatite, Nebraska, USA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaolong Wei","Jiajia Sun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635724800,"objectID":"4462e6929e716e8f7d767c49fc1335fd","permalink":"https://xiaolongw1223.github.io/publication/2021_uncertainty/","publishdate":"2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021_uncertainty/","section":"publication","summary":"The non-uniqueness problem in geophysical inversion, especially potential-field inversion, is widely recognized. It is argued that uncertainty analysis of a recovered model should be as important as finding an optimal model. However, quantifying uncertainty still remains challenging, especially for $3$D inversions in both deterministic and Bayesian frameworks. Our objective is to develop an efficient method to empirically quantify the uncertainty of the physical property models recovered from 3D potential-field inversion. We worked in a deterministic framework where an objective function consisting of a data misfit term and a regularization term is minimized. We performed inversions using a mixed Lp-norm formulation where various combinations of Lp ($0\\leq p\\leq2$) norms can be implemented on different components of the regularization term. Specifically, we randomly sampled the p-norm values in multiple times, and generated a large and diverse sequence of physical property models that all reproduce the observed geophysical data equally well. This suite of models offers practical insights into the uncertainty of the recovered model features. We quantified the uncertainty through calculation of standard deviations and interquartile range, as well as visualizations in box plots and histograms. The numerical results for a realistic synthetic density model created based on a ring-shaped igneous intrusive body quantitatively illustrate uncertainty reduction due to different amounts of prior information imposed on inversions. We also applied the method to a field data set over the Decorah area in the northeastern Iowa. We adopted an acceptance-rejection strategy to generate 31 equivalent models based on which the uncertainties of the inverted models as well as the volume and mass estimates are quantified.","tags":[],"title":"Uncertainty analysis of 3D potential-field deterministic inversion using mixed L p norms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiajia Sun","Xiaolong Wei"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606867200,"objectID":"725bf22196454ee97f5fdc4a7cdf46d7","permalink":"https://xiaolongw1223.github.io/publication/2020_sparse/","publishdate":"2020-12-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_sparse/","section":"publication","summary":"Sparse inversions have proven to be useful for interpreting potential‐field data because the recovered models are characterized by sharp boundaries, compact features and elevated values, compared with conventional smoothness‐based inversion results.

We have used high-resolution airborne magnetic and gravity gradient data over northeast Iowa to characterize the geology of the concealed Precambrian rocks and evaluate the prospectivity of mineral deposits. Previous researchers have interpreted the magnetic and gravity gradient data in the form of a 2D geologic map of the Precambrian basement rocks, which provides important geophysical constraints on the geologic history and mineral potentials over the Decorah area located in the northeast of Iowa. However, their interpretations are based on 2D data maps and are limited to the two horizontal dimensions. To fully tap into the rich information contained in the high-resolution airborne geophysical data, and to further our understanding of the undercover geology, we have performed separate and joint inversions of magnetic and gravity gradient data to obtain 3D density contrast models and 3D susceptibility models, based on which we carried out geology differentiation. Based on separately inverted physical property values, we have identified 10 geologic units and their spatial distributions in 3D which are all summarized in a 3D quasi-geology model. The extension of 2D geologic interpretation to 3D allows for the discovery of four previously unidentified geologic units, a more detailed classification of the Yavapai country rock, and the identification of the highly anomalous core of the mafic intrusions. Joint inversion allows for the classification of a few geologic units further into several subclasses. We have demonstrated the added value of the construction of a 3D quasi-geology model based on 3D separate and joint inversions.","tags":[],"title":"Unveiling the 3D undercover structure of a Precambrian intrusive complex by integrating airborne magnetic and gravity gradient data into 3D quasi-geology model building","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
