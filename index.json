A key issue of joint inversion is to develop effective strategies to link different geophysical data in a unified mathematical framework, where the information obtained from different models can complement each other. In this paper, we propose a deep learning enhanced (DLE) joint inversion framework to simultaneously reconstruct different physical models by fusing different types of geophysical data. Traditionally, structure similarity constraints are pursued by joint inversion algorithms using manually crafted formulations (e.g. cross gradient). In this work, the constraint is constructed by a deep neural network (DNN) during the learning process. The framework is designed to combine the DNN and the traditional independent inversion workflow together and improve the joint inversion result iteratively. The network can be easily extended to incorporate multi-physics without structural changes. Numerical experiments on the joint inversion of 2D DC resistivity data and seismic travel time show that the DLE framework achieves more accurate recovered property values and structural features than independent inversions and conventional cross gradient based joint inversion. In addition, this learning-based framework demonstrates excellent generalization abilities when tested on datasets using divergent geological structures. It can also handle different sensing configurations and nonconforming discretization.","tags":[],"title":"A deep learning enhanced framework for multi-physics joint inversion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaolong Wei","Kenneth Li","Jiajia Sun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1648771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648771200,"objectID":"2161a17c7d877d97dbedb371c1b6dc30","permalink":"https://xiaolongw1223.github.io/publication/2022_elk_creek/","publishdate":"2022-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_elk_creek/","section":"publication","summary":"Critical minerals are an integral part of the energy transition because of their important and, sometimes, irreplaceable uses in solar panels, wind turbines, electrical vehicles, etc. Mapping critical mineral resources is, therefore, essential to achieving the net-zero emission goal by 2050.

It is argued that uncertainty analysis of a recovered model should be as important as finding an optimal model. However, quantifying uncertainty still remains challenging, especially for $3$D inversions in both deterministic and Bayesian frameworks. Our objective is to develop an efficient method to empirically quantify the uncertainty of the physical property models recovered from 3D potential-field inversion. We worked in a deterministic framework where an objective function consisting of a data misfit term and a regularization term is minimized. We performed inversions using a mixed Lp-norm formulation where various combinations of Lp ($0\\leq p\\leq2$) norms can be implemented on different components of the regularization term. Specifically, we randomly sampled the p-norm values in multiple times, and generated a large and diverse sequence of physical property models that all reproduce the observed geophysical data equally well. This suite of models offers practical insights into the uncertainty of the recovered model features. We quantified the uncertainty through calculation of standard deviations and interquartile range, as well as visualizations in box plots and histograms. The numerical results for a realistic synthetic density model created based on a ring-shaped igneous intrusive body quantitatively illustrate uncertainty reduction due to different amounts of prior information imposed on inversions. We also applied the method to a field data set over the Decorah area in the northeastern Iowa.
