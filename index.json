I obtained my M.S. in geology in 2018 from Northwest University, Xi’an, China, and B.S. in geophysics in 2015 from China University of Geosciences in Beijing.\nDue to the burgeoning human population, growing needs for natural resources as well as concerns about global food security, climate changes and natural hazards, it is significant, probably urgent, to more fully integrate geoscientific observations and understand Earth subsurface systems for a sustainable management of our planet.\nMy research interests resolve around the theme of integrated Earth modeling and uncertainty analysis to investigate and monitor various subsurface systems using multiple data sets. My research interdisciplinarily utilizes, though by far not all, optimization, Monte Carlo, geostatistics, pattern recognition and mineralogy. I am currently working on joint inversion and uncertainty quantification using potential field (i.e., gravity, gradiometry and magnetic) and petrophysical (i.e., rock samples and drillhole) data, primarily applied to the critical mineral explorations.\nMethodology Research: a.
